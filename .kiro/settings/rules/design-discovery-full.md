# Full Discovery Process for Technical Design

## Objective

Conduct comprehensive research and analysis to ensure the technical design is based on complete, accurate, and up-to-date information.

## Discovery Steps

### 1. Requirements Analysis

**Map Requirements to Technical Needs**

- Extract all functional requirements from EARS format
- Identify non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Determine technical constraints and dependencies
- List core technical challenges

### 2. Existing Implementation Analysis

**Understand Current System** (if modifying/extending):

- Analyze codebase structure and architecture patterns
- Map reusable components, services, utilities
- Identify domain boundaries and data flows
- Document integration points and dependencies
- Determine approach: extend vs refactor vs wrap

### 3. Technology Research

**Investigate Best Practices and Solutions**:

- **Use WebSearch** to find:
  - Latest architectural patterns for similar problems
  - Industry best practices for the technology stack
  - Recent updates or changes in relevant technologies
  - Common pitfalls and solutions

- **Use WebFetch** to analyze:
  - Official documentation for frameworks/libraries
  - API references and usage examples
  - Migration guides and breaking changes
  - Performance benchmarks and comparisons

### 4. External Dependencies Investigation

**For Each External Service/Library**:

- Search for official documentation and GitHub repositories
- Verify API signatures and authentication methods
- Check version compatibility with existing stack
- Investigate rate limits and usage constraints
- Find community resources and known issues
- Document security considerations
- Note any gaps requiring implementation investigation

### 5. Architecture Pattern & Boundary Analysis

**Evaluate Architectural Options**:

- Compare relevant patterns (MVC, Clean, Hexagonal, Event-driven)
- Assess fit with existing architecture and steering principles
- Identify domain boundaries and ownership seams required to avoid team conflicts
- Consider scalability implications and operational concerns
- Evaluate maintainability and team expertise
- Document preferred pattern and rejected alternatives in `research.md`

### 6. Risk Assessment

**Identify Technical Risks**:

- Performance bottlenecks and scaling limits
- Security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Integration complexity and coupling
- Technical debt creation vs resolution
- Knowledge gaps and training needs

## Research Guidelines

### When to Search

**Always search for**:

- External API documentation and updates
- Security best practices for authentication/authorization
- Performance optimization techniques for identified bottlenecks
- Latest versions and migration paths for dependencies

**Search if uncertain about**:

- Architectural patterns for specific use cases
- Industry standards for data formats/protocols
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Scalability approaches for expected load

### Search Strategy

1. Start with official sources (documentation, GitHub)
2. Check recent blog posts and articles (last 6 months)
3. Review Stack Overflow for common issues
4. Investigate similar open-source implementations

## Output Requirements

Capture all findings that impact design decisions in `research.md` using the shared template:

- Key insights affecting architecture, technology alignment, and contracts
- Constraints discovered during research
- Recommended approaches and selected architecture pattern with rationale
- Rejected alternatives and trade-offs (documented in the Design Decisions section)
- Updated domain boundaries that inform Components & Interface Contracts
- Risks and mitigation strategies
- Gaps requiring further investigation during implementation
