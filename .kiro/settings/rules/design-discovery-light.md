# Light Discovery Process for Extensions

## Objective

Quickly analyze existing system and integration requirements for feature extensions.

## Focused Discovery Steps

### 1. Extension Point Analysis

**Identify Integration Approach**:

- Locate existing extension points or interfaces
- Determine modification scope (files, components)
- Check for existing patterns to follow
- Identify backward compatibility requirements

### 2. Dependency Check

**Verify Compatibility**:

- Check version compatibility of new dependencies
- Validate API contracts haven't changed
- Ensure no breaking changes in pipeline

### 3. Quick Technology Verification

**For New Libraries Only**:

- Use WebSearch for official documentation
- Verify basic usage patterns
- Check for known compatibility issues
- Confirm licensing compatibility
- Record key findings in `research.md` (technology alignment section)

### 4. Integration Risk Assessment

**Quick Risk Check**:

- Impact on existing functionality
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Testing requirements

## When to Escalate to Full Discovery

Switch to full discovery if you find:

- Significant architectural changes needed
- Complex external service integrations
- Security-sensitive implementations
- Performance-critical components
- Unknown or poorly documented dependencies

## Output Requirements

- Clear integration approach (note boundary impacts in `research.md`)
- List of files/components to modify
- New dependencies with versions
- Integration risks and mitigations
- Testing focus areas
