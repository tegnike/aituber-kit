# Design Document Template

---

**Purpose**: Provide sufficient detail to ensure implementation consistency across different implementers, preventing interpretation drift.

**Approach**:

- Include essential sections that directly inform implementation decisions
- Omit optional sections unless critical to preventing implementation errors
- Match detail level to feature complexity
- Use diagrams and tables over lengthy prose

## **Warning**: Approaching 1000 lines indicates excessive feature complexity that may require design simplification.

> Sections may be reordered (e.g., surfacing Requirements Traceability earlier or moving Data Models nearer Architecture) when it improves clarity. Within each section, keep the flow **Summary → Scope → Decisions → Impacts/Risks** so reviewers can scan consistently.

## Overview

2-3 paragraphs max
**Purpose**: This feature delivers [specific value] to [target users].
**Users**: [Target user groups] will utilize this for [specific workflows].
**Impact** (if applicable): Changes the current [system state] by [specific modifications].

### Goals

- Primary objective 1
- Primary objective 2
- Success criteria

### Non-Goals

- Explicitly excluded functionality
- Future considerations outside current scope
- Integration points deferred

## Architecture

> Reference detailed discovery notes in `research.md` only for background; keep design.md self-contained for reviewers by capturing all decisions and contracts here.
> Capture key decisions in text and let diagrams carry structural detail—avoid repeating the same information in prose.

### Existing Architecture Analysis (if applicable)

When modifying existing systems:

- Current architecture patterns and constraints
- Existing domain boundaries to be respected
- Integration points that must be maintained
- Technical debt addressed or worked around

### Architecture Pattern & Boundary Map

**RECOMMENDED**: Include Mermaid diagram showing the chosen architecture pattern and system boundaries (required for complex features, optional for simple additions)

**Architecture Integration**:

- Selected pattern: [name and brief rationale]
- Domain/feature boundaries: [how responsibilities are separated to avoid conflicts]
- Existing patterns preserved: [list key patterns]
- New components rationale: [why each is needed]
- Steering compliance: [principles maintained]

### Technology Stack

| Layer                    | Choice / Version | Role in Feature | Notes |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Frontend / CLI           |                  |                 |       |
| Backend / Services       |                  |                 |       |
| Data / Storage           |                  |                 |       |
| Messaging / Events       |                  |                 |       |
| Infrastructure / Runtime |                  |                 |       |

> Keep rationale concise here and, when more depth is required (trade-offs, benchmarks), add a short summary plus pointer to the Supporting References section and `research.md` for raw investigation notes.

## System Flows

Provide only the diagrams needed to explain non-trivial flows. Use pure Mermaid syntax. Common patterns:

- Sequence (multi-party interactions)
- Process / state (branching logic or lifecycle)
- Data / event flow (pipelines, async messaging)

Skip this section entirely for simple CRUD changes.

> Describe flow-level decisions (e.g., gating conditions, retries) briefly after the diagram instead of restating each step.

## Requirements Traceability

Use this section for complex or compliance-sensitive features where requirements span multiple domains. Straightforward 1:1 mappings can rely on the Components summary table.

Map each requirement ID (e.g., `2.1`) to the design elements that realize it.

| Requirement | Summary | Components | Interfaces | Flows |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1.1         |         |            |            |       |
| 1.2         |         |            |            |       |

> Omit this section only when a single component satisfies a single requirement without cross-cutting concerns.

## Components and Interfaces

Provide a quick reference before diving into per-component details.

- Summaries can be a table or compact list. Example table:
  | Component | Domain/Layer | Intent | Req Coverage | Key Dependencies (P0/P1) | Contracts |
  |-----------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------------------------|-----------|
  | ExampleComponent | UI | Displays XYZ | 1, 2 | GameProvider (P0), MapPanel (P1) | Service, State |
- Only components introducing new boundaries (e.g., logic hooks, external integrations, persistence) require full detail blocks. Simple presentation components can rely on the summary row plus a short Implementation Note.

Group detailed blocks by domain or architectural layer. For each detailed component, list requirement IDs as `2.1, 2.3` (omit “Requirement”). When multiple UI components share the same contract, reference a base interface/props definition instead of duplicating code blocks.

### [Domain / Layer]

#### [Component Name]

| Field             | Detail                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Intent            | 1-line description of the responsibility |
| Requirements      | 2.1, 2.3                                 |
| Owner / Reviewers | (optional)                               |

**Responsibilities & Constraints**

Skip subsections that are not relevant to this feature.

## Error Handling

### Error Strategy

Concrete error handling patterns and recovery mechanisms for each error type.

### Error Categories and Responses

**User Errors** (4xx): Invalid input → field-level validation; Unauthorized → auth guidance; Not found → navigation help
**System Errors** (5xx): Infrastructure failures → graceful degradation; Timeouts → circuit breakers; Exhaustion → rate limiting  
**Business Logic Errors** (422): Rule violations → condition explanations; State conflicts → transition guidance

**Process Flow Visualization** (when complex business logic exists):
Include Mermaid flowchart only for complex error scenarios with business workflows.

### Monitoring

Error tracking, logging, and health monitoring implementation.

## Testing Strategy

### Default sections (adapt names/sections to fit the domain)

- Unit Tests: 3–5 items from core functions/modules (e.g., auth methods, subscription logic)
- Integration Tests: 3–5 cross-component flows (e.g., webhook handling, notifications)
- E2E/UI Tests (if applicable): 3–5 critical user paths (e.g., forms, dashboards)
- Performance/Load (if applicable): 3–4 items (e.g., concurrency, high-volume ops)

## Optional Sections (include when relevant)

### Security Considerations

_Use this section for features handling auth, sensitive data, external integrations, or user permissions. Capture only decisions unique to this feature; defer baseline controls to steering docs._

- Threat modeling, security controls, compliance requirements
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Data protection and privacy considerations

### Performance & Scalability

_Use this section when performance targets, high load, or scaling concerns exist. Record only feature-specific targets or trade-offs and rely on steering documents for general practices._

- Target metrics and measurement strategies
- Scaling approaches (horizontal/vertical)
- Caching strategies and optimization techniques

### Migration Strategy

Include a Mermaid flowchart showing migration phases when schema/data movement is required.

- Phase breakdown, rollback triggers, validation checkpoints

## Supporting References (Optional)

- Create this section only when keeping the information in the main body would hurt readability (e.g., very long TypeScript definitions, vendor option matrices, exhaustive schema tables). Keep decision-making context in the main sections so the design stays self-contained.
- Link to the supporting references from the main text instead of inlining large snippets.
- Background research notes and comparisons continue to live in `research.md`, but their conclusions must be summarized in the main design.
