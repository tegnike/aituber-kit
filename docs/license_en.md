- **Exhibitions and demonstrations** aimed at increasing the project's recognition are not subject to commercial licenses.
- **When using the Live2D feature**, an additional fee of 40% of the basic license fee will be charged. This is because when revenue is generated from services utilizing Live2D models, there is an obligation to pay a portion of the revenue as a license fee to Live2D Inc. If the Live2D feature is not needed from the beginning, no additional fee will be incurred. If it becomes necessary later, it can be used by paying the additional fee at that time, provided you contact us before starting to use it. Additionally, regarding the use of Live2D, the conditions stated in the "Third Party Licenses" section below also apply.
