## Security Considerations

This repository is intended for personal use, local development, and commercial use with appropriate security measures. However, please note the following when deploying to a web environment:

- **API Key Handling**: The system is designed to call AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and TTS services via a backend server, so proper API key management is necessary.

### Production Use

When using in a production environment, one of the following approaches is recommended:

1. **Implement a Backend Server**: Manage API keys on the server side and avoid direct API access from clients
2. **Provide Appropriate Explanations to Users**: If users are using their own API keys, explain the security considerations
3. **Implement Access Restrictions**: Implement appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms as needed
