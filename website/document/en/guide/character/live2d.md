# Live2D Settings

## Overview

Live2D is a model format that allows realistic movement to be added to 2D illustrations, and in AITuberKit, you can use Live2D models to display AI characters.

## Technical Implementation

For Live2D display, we use the unofficial library [pixi-live2d-display](https://github.com/RaSan147/pixi-live2d-display).
Live2D provides a library called Cubism as a development SDK, and AITuberKit uses the official SDK with permission from Live2D.

### Cubism Core Setup

To use the Live2D feature, please place the following file in `public/scripts`:

`live2dcubismcore.min.js` (for Cubism 4/5)

- Available for download from the [official site](https://www.live2d.com/sdk/download/web/)
- Or available [here](https://cubism.live2d.com/sdk-web/cubismcore/live2dcubismcore.min.js) (Note: Not recommended for production use)

When publishing software that incorporates Live2D's Cubism SDK, you may need to enter into a publishing license agreement with Live2D. For details, please refer to the following page:

## Preparing Live2D Models

AITuberKit supports Live2D Cubism 3 and later models. To use a Live2D model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a Live2D model folder
2. Place the model folder in the `public/live2d` directory (the `model3.json` file must exist directly under this folder)
3. Select the Live2D model in the application

## Selecting Models

Live2D models available in the application can be selected from a dropdown menu. The model switches in real-time when selected.

## How to Operate the Model

2D models can be freely adjusted with the following operations:

### Adjusting Position and Size

#### On PC

- **Left-click or Right-click + Drag**: Move the character's position
- **Mouse wheel scrolling**: Enlarge or reduce the character's size

#### On Smartphone

- **Tap + Drag**: Move the character's position
- **Pinch in/out with two fingers**: Enlarge or reduce the character's size

By combining these operations, you can adjust the character's position on the screen to the optimal state. Customize the character's appearance as you see fit according to the layout of the broadcast screen.

## Expression Settings

You can set the Live2D model's expressions into five emotion categories:

- **Neutral**: Normal expression displayed after conversation completion, etc.
- **Happy**: Expressions that represent joy or fun
- **Sad**: Expressions that represent sadness or confusion
- **Angry**: Expressions that represent anger or focus
- **Relaxed**: Expressions that represent a relaxed state
- **Surprised**: Expressions that represent surprise

For each emotion category, you can assign any number of expressions from those available in the model. If multiple are specified with commas, one will be selected randomly.

## Motion Group Settings

You can set the Live2D model's motions into six categories:

- **Idle**: Idle state motion displayed after conversation completion, etc.
- **Neutral**: Motion for the normal emotional state
- **Happy**: Motion for the joyful emotional state
- **Sad**: Motion for the sad emotional state
- **Angry**: Motion for the angry emotional state
- **Relaxed**: Motion for the relaxed emotional state
- **Surprised**: Motion for the surprised emotional state

For each category, you can select one motion group from those available in the model.

## Notes About Models

- Some models may take time to load
- If using an original Live2D model, please customize the expression and motion group settings to match your model
- The default values correspond to the models provided with AITuberKit

### Model Compatibility

AITuberKit supports Cubism 3 and later models, but some models may not work properly due to compatibility issues.

- Many free Live2D models distributed on platforms like Booth have been confirmed to work, but some models may not work for unknown reasons
- Regarding Cubism Editor versions, there are reports that models up to version 4 are mostly compatible, but we cannot guarantee complete compatibility with the latest version 5 models

## About Live2D Model Licenses
